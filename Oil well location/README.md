# Oil Well Location Project

This project aims to determine the most profitable region for drilling a new oil well using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset contains oil samples from three regions. Each region has 10,000 oil fields, with measurements for oil quality and reserve volume. The data is clean, with no missing values, and all features are quantitative.

## Main Points and Goals

- Analyze the provided data for each region.
- Build and validate machine learning models to predict oil reserves.
- Use statistical techniques (Bootstrap) to estimate profit and risk for each region.
- Recommend the region with the highest expected profit and lowest risk.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy
- phik
- scikit-learn

The analysis includes data preprocessing, correlation analysis, model training, profit calculation, and risk assessment.
