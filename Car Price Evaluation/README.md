# Car Price Evaluation Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the market value of used cars based on their technical characteristics and historical sales data. The main goal is to provide a fast and accurate price estimation service for car owners.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about used cars, including:
- Technical features (power, mileage, year, gearbox, fuel type, etc.)
- Brand and model
- Dates (listing creation, crawling, last seen)
- Target variable: car price in euros

## Main Steps and Goals

- Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning (Ridge Regression and LightGBM)
- Model evaluation and comparison (RMSE, speed)
- Final model selection and summary

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- missingno
- scikit-learn
- lightgbm
- phik

The project demonstrates the full cycle of a regression ML task, from data cleaning to model evaluation.
